## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains the complete pipeline used for processing, analyzing, and validating beetle specimen images and morphometric measurements for the [2018 NEON Ethanol-preserved Ground Beetles](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/2018-NEON-beetles) and [Hawaii Beetles](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/Hawaii-beetles) datasets. The project focuses on **Carabidae** (ground beetles) and implements:

1. **Automated beetle detection and cropping** from group images using CVAT annotations and zero-shot object detection.
2. **Morphometric trait extraction** including elytra length and width measurements.
3. **Inter-annotator agreement analysis** comparing measurements between human annotators.
4. **Human vs. automated system validation** evaluating algorithmic measurements against manual measurements.
5. **Species distribution visualization** for PUUM (Pu'u Maka'ala Natural Area Reserve, Hawaii) site data.

The pipeline integrates computer vision (Grounding DINO), traditional image processing, and statistical validation to create a robust, reproducible workflow for entomological specimen digitization.

## 🔬 Pipeline Components

### 1. **Image Annotation and Extraction**

**File:** `2018_neon_beetles_bbox.xml`

CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) annotations containing:
- 577 annotated images
- Bounding box coordinates for individual beetles in group images
- Image dimensions (5568 × 3712 pixels)
- Created: April 2025

**Format:**
```xml
<image id="0" name="group_images/A00000001831.jpg" width="5568" height="3712">
    <box label="bbox" xtl="2051.88" ytl="1881.84" xbr="2417.17" ybr="2473.22"/>
    ...
</image>
```

### 2. **Traditional Bounding Box Cropping**

**Script:** `2018_neon_beetles_get_individual_images.py`

Extracts individual beetle specimens from annotated group images using CVAT XML annotations.

**Features:**
- Parses CVAT XML format
- Extracts bounding box coordinates
- Crops individual specimens with optional padding
- Saves as separate PNG files with specimen numbering
- Progress tracking with tqdm

**Key Functions:**
- `parse_cvat_annotations(xml_path)`: Parse CVAT XML and extract image metadata
- `crop_and_save_images(images_data, images_dir, output_dir, padding)`: Crop and save specimens

### 3. **Image Resizing with Uniform Scaling**

**Script:** `resizing_individual_beetle_images.py`

Resizes individual beetle specimen images to match BeetlePalooza's resized group images using uniform scaling factors. <<<< Is this for the 2018 NEON beetles to get measurements based on Zooniverse size???

**Purpose:**
- Aligns individual specimen images with the resolution of BeetlePalooza's processed group images
- Ensures morphometric measurements made on resized images can be accurately applied to individual specimens
- Uses uniform scaling (average of x and y scale factors) for consistency

**Workflow:**
1. Calculate uniform scaling factors between original and BeetlePalooza resized group images
2. Save scaling factors to JSON for reference and reproducibility
3. Apply uniform scaling to all individual specimen images
4. Generate processing summary with statistics

### 4. **Dataset Upload to Hugging Face**

**Script:** `upload_dataset_to_hf.py`

Utility script for uploading processed beetle datasets to Hugging Face Hub for public access and reproducibility.

**Usage:**
```bash
export HF_TOKEN="your_hugging_face_token"

python upload_dataset_to_hf.py \
    --folder_path /path/to/local/images \
    --repo_id imageomics/dataset-name \
    --path_in_repo images \
    --branch main
```

**Parameters:**
- `--folder_path`: Local directory containing files to upload
- `--repo_id`: Hugging Face repository identifier (org/repo-name)
- `--path_in_repo`: Subdirectory within the repository (default: "images")
- `--repo_type`: Repository type - "dataset" or "model" (default: "dataset")
- `--branch`: Target branch name (default: "main")

### 5. **Zero-Shot Object Detection**

**Notebook:** `grounding_dino.ipynb`

Advanced pipeline using **Grounding DINO** for automated beetle detection and segmentation.

**Workflow:**
1. Load beetle measurements from the [2018 NEON Ethanol-preserved Ground Beetles dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/2018-NEON-beetles)
2. Initialize Grounding DINO model (IDEA-Research/grounding-dino-base)
3. For each image:
   - Detect beetles using text prompt ("a beetle")
   - Filter detections based on adaptive area thresholds
   - Verify detections contain elytra measurement points
   - Apply Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to remove duplicates
   - Select best bounding box (largest area with highest confidence)
4. Save individual beetle images and CSV metadata

### 6. **Inter-Annotator Agreement**

**Script:** `inter_annotator.py`

Quantifies measurement consistency between multiple human annotators for continuous morphometric traits.

**Analysis:**
- Compares three annotator pairs:
  - Annotator A vs. Annotator B
  - Annotator B vs. Annotator C
  - Annotator C vs. Annotator A

**Metrics Computed:**
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error): Overall measurement disagreement
- **R² Score**: Correlation strength between annotators
- **Average Bias**: Systematic over/under-measurement tendencies

**Output:**
- `InterAnnotatorAgreement.pdf`: Three-panel scatter plot
- Console report with detailed metrics

### 7. **Human vs. Automated System Validation**

**Script:** `calipers_vs_toras.py`

Evaluates TORAS measurement annotations performance against human expert measurements using calipers (gold standard).

**Comparisons:**
- Annotator A vs. Automated System
- Annotator B vs. Automated System
- Annotator C vs. Automated System
- Average Human vs. Automated System

**Metrics:**
- RMSE, R², Average Bias (same as inter-annotator analysis)

**Output:**

- Quantitative performance metrics


### 8. **NEON Data Analysis and Visualization**

**Script:** `Figure6and10.R`

Comprehensive analysis of NEON beetle data from PUUM site (Hawaii) with BeetlePalooza integration.

**Data Sources:**
- **NEON API**: DP1.10022.001 (Ground beetle sequences DNA barcode)
- **BeetlePalooza**: Citizen science measurement data
- Site: PUUM (Pu'u Maka'ala Natural Area Reserve, Hawaii)

**Outputs:**
- `BeetlePUUM_abundance.png`: Species abundance with imaging status (Not Imaged vs. Imaged)
- Merged dataset combining NEON taxonomic data with BeetlePalooza measurements

**R Libraries:**
- `ggplot2`: Data visualization
- `dplyr`: Data manipulation
- `ggpubr`: Publication-ready themes
- `neonUtilities`: NEON API interface
